# CLAUDE.md — Revenge of the Evil Aliens (web port)

Porting a recovered 2008 **XBLIG** (XNA 3.x, C#) to run in the browser via **KNI**
(a MonoGame fork with a Blazor WebAssembly / WebGL backend). Output = a static site.

**`plan.md` is the staged plan** (content → boot → shaders → audio → saves → hosting → polish);
each stage is written to be done independently with fresh context. This file is how to *work*
in the repo. (Global prefs — `rtk` git, `python` not `python3`, the `edit_unicode.py` helper —
still apply.)

## Build / run / verify
```sh
cd web/EvilAliensWeb
dotnet build -c Debug
dotnet run -c Debug --urls http://localhost:5280     # then open the URL
```
- **A clean `dotnet build` does NOT mean it runs.** WASM runtime errors only appear in the
  **browser console** — always verify visually *and* read the console. Use the preview tools
  against the `eaweb` config in `.claude/launch.json` (`preview_start` → `preview_screenshot`
  → `preview_console_logs`).
- **Verify with the `claude-in-chrome` MCP, not `preview_screenshot`.** A real foreground
  Chrome tab screenshots + reads console reliably; the built-in preview renderer wedges
  whenever *its* tab is backgrounded (the rAF game loop pauses, so it never paints). Flow:
  `preview_start` to serve → in Chrome `navigate` to `http://localhost:5280` → `wait` ~10s
  for WASM → `computer{screenshot}`/`zoom` + `read_console_messages`.

## Toolchain (already installed)
- .NET 8 SDK + `wasm-tools` workload (Emscripten / mono browser-wasm).
- KNI `4.1.9001.*` (`nkast.Xna.Framework.*`) — **this is the engine**; namespace is
  `Microsoft.Xna.Framework` and the API is XNA **4.0** (the game was 3.x → mind the gap).
- `ilspycmd` decompiler: run as `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor ilspycmd ...`.

## Layout
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `web/EvilAliensWeb/Game/` | the ported game code — **edit here** |
| `web/EvilAliensWeb/Compat/` | Xbox-API + XNA-3.x→4.0 shims |
| `web/EvilAliensWeb/wwwroot/` | host page + JS game-loop glue |
| `src_decompiled/` | decompiled reference source (read-only) |
| `extracted/584E07D1/Content/` | game assets unpacked from the package |
| `tools/` | scripts that DERIVED `Game/` from `src_decompiled/` |

## Critical context / gotchas
- **The recovered code is the Xbox BUILD.** Anything under `#if WINDOWS` / `[Conditional]`
  was stripped at compile time and is unrecoverable from this binary. Re-create PC-only
  behaviour; don't hunt for it. (If a PC `.exe` ever turns up, decompile that too.)
- **`Game/` is GENERATED** from `src_decompiled/` by `tools/*.py` (ref-cast artifacts,
  `_002Ector`→`new T(...)`, `((Base)this).` → `base.`, 3.x→4.0 edits). They're already applied.
  **Do NOT re-run them** — they rewrite `Game/` from the pristine source and would clobber any
  later hand edits. Edit `Game/` directly.
- **Shims in `Compat/` fake the Xbox APIs.** GamerServices = no-ops (full game unlocked,
  `SignedInGamers` empty so per-gamer loops do nothing); Storage = WASM in-memory FS (not yet
  persistent). `ResolveBackBuffer` and the `SpriteBlendMode`→`BlendState` mapping are now
  **real** (Stage 5); the `Effect`/`EffectPass` `Begin/End` no-op shims are dead (no callers).
- **It runs (Stages 4–5 done).** `Game1` boots through splash → menu → playable/attract gameplay
  with shaders (gamma, bloom, sprite effects) and 0 console exceptions. Remaining: audio
  (Stage 6), persistent saves (Stage 7), hosting (8), polish/fullscreen (9). See `plan.md`
  "Stage 4 — DONE" / "Stage 5 — DONE" for what changed and the stubs each later stage must un-stub.
- **Shaders (Stage 5):** the lost `.fx` were rewritten in `tools/shaders/src/` and compiled
  offline to MGFX v10 GLSL `.mgfxo` by `tools/shaders/build_shaders.py` (KNI's MGCB, BlazorGL
  target — needs `nkast.Xna.Framework.Content.Pipeline.Builder.Windows 4.1.9001` restored in the
  nuget cache). `WebContentManager` loads them via `new Effect(gd,bytes)`. **Re-run the script
  after editing any `.fx`; don't hand-edit `.mgfxo`.** Effects apply via `SpriteBatch.Begin(effect)`
  (4.0 model), not `effect.Begin()`.
- **Sign-in / keyboard:** `SignedInGamers` is still empty, but the XBLIG sign-in gate is gone —
  the PC keyboard path was recreated, incl. **reconstructing the `#if WINDOWS`-stripped
  keyboard-read block in `InputHandler.Update()`** (the Xbox build discarded `Keyboard.GetState()`
  and left the `keysToCheck` table dead). Keyboard: arrows/WASD move, Enter select/start, Esc back.
- **Game loop is JS-driven:** `wwwroot/index.html` (`initRenderJS`/`tickJS`) →
  `Pages/Index.razor.cs` `TickDotNet()` → now `new EvilAliens.Game1()`. `ContentTestGame.cs` /
  `SpikeGame.cs` are dead harnesses, safe to delete.
- **Real keyboard input works** — KNI maps keys via **`event.keyCode`** (decompiled from
  `Kni.Platform`: `Keys = (Keys)keyCode`), so Enter/arrows/WASD/Esc are correct for real users.
  When *driving* the browser, prefer **real OS keys** via the claude-in-chrome `computer` `key`
  action (held across a frame). **Synthetic JS `KeyboardEvent`s do NOT work** — KNI's WASM
  keyboard interop throws `JSON value could not be converted to System.Int32` on the faked
  `keyCode` and can leave a key stuck. Click-to-focus the canvas first.
- **Stubs that will read as "broken" until their stage (not bugs):**
  `SoundManager` XACT is try/caught to null = silent (Stage 6); saves are in-memory (Stage 7);
  the controls-help screen shows the **Xbox joypad** (PC keyboard help was `#if WINDOWS`-stripped,
  Stage 9).
- **Resolution = a presenter, not a pinned back buffer.** KNI's BlazorGL forces the back buffer to
  the browser window size and rewrites `PreferredBackBuffer` on every resize, so a fixed 800×600
  reverts. `Game1.Draw` renders the 800×600 frame into an offscreen `sceneTarget` and blits it
  scaled+letterboxed to the window; the game's `SetRenderTarget(0, null)` calls are redirected to
  that target via `Xna3GraphicsDeviceCompat.BaseRenderTarget`. Don't re-introduce a pinned
  `PreferredBackBuffer`. Stage 5 applies the gamma shader on the present blit of this target, and
  bloom renders into it (its targets are sized 800×600 to match); Stage 9 adds fullscreen.

## Don'ts
- Don't commit `bin/`/`obj/` or the raw 52 MB Xbox package (all `.gitignore`d).
- Don't re-run `tools/*.py` against `Game/` (regenerates it from scratch).
- Don't trust a screenshot for colours/blending while shaders are stubbed.
