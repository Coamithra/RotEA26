# CLAUDE.md — Revenge of the Evil Aliens (web port)

Porting a recovered 2008 **XBLIG** (XNA 3.x, C#) to run in the browser via **KNI**
(a MonoGame fork with a Blazor WebAssembly / WebGL backend). Output = a static site.

**`plan.md` is the staged plan** (content → boot → shaders → audio → saves → hosting → polish);
each stage is written to be done independently with fresh context. This file is how to *work*
in the repo. (Global prefs — `rtk` git, `python` not `python3`, the `edit_unicode.py` helper —
still apply.)

## Build / run / verify
```sh
cd web/EvilAliensWeb
dotnet build -c Debug
dotnet run -c Debug --urls http://localhost:5280     # then open the URL
```
- **A clean `dotnet build` does NOT mean it runs.** WASM runtime errors only appear in the
  **browser console** — always verify visually *and* read the console. Use the preview tools
  against the `eaweb` config in `.claude/launch.json` (`preview_start` → `preview_screenshot`
  → `preview_console_logs`).

## Toolchain (already installed)
- .NET 8 SDK + `wasm-tools` workload (Emscripten / mono browser-wasm).
- KNI `4.1.9001.*` (`nkast.Xna.Framework.*`) — **this is the engine**; namespace is
  `Microsoft.Xna.Framework` and the API is XNA **4.0** (the game was 3.x → mind the gap).
- `ilspycmd` decompiler: run as `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor ilspycmd ...`.

## Layout
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `web/EvilAliensWeb/Game/` | the ported game code — **edit here** |
| `web/EvilAliensWeb/Compat/` | Xbox-API + XNA-3.x→4.0 shims |
| `web/EvilAliensWeb/wwwroot/` | host page + JS game-loop glue |
| `src_decompiled/` | decompiled reference source (read-only) |
| `extracted/584E07D1/Content/` | game assets unpacked from the package |
| `tools/` | scripts that DERIVED `Game/` from `src_decompiled/` |

## Critical context / gotchas
- **The recovered code is the Xbox BUILD.** Anything under `#if WINDOWS` / `[Conditional]`
  was stripped at compile time and is unrecoverable from this binary. Re-create PC-only
  behaviour; don't hunt for it. (If a PC `.exe` ever turns up, decompile that too.)
- **`Game/` is GENERATED** from `src_decompiled/` by `tools/*.py` (ref-cast artifacts,
  `_002Ector`→`new T(...)`, `((Base)this).` → `base.`, 3.x→4.0 edits). They're already applied.
  **Do NOT re-run them** — they rewrite `Game/` from the pristine source and would clobber any
  later hand edits. Edit `Game/` directly.
- **Shims in `Compat/` fake the Xbox APIs.** GamerServices = no-ops (full game unlocked,
  `SignedInGamers` empty so per-gamer loops do nothing); Storage = WASM in-memory FS (not yet
  persistent). Some shims are **no-ops that affect runtime until their stage** — `Effect`/
  `EffectPass` `Begin/End` and `ResolveBackBuffer` (shaders, Stage 5), and the
  `SpriteBlendMode`→`BlendState` mapping (verify visually). Don't mistake these for bugs.
- **Not runnable yet.** Blockers in order: content load (Stage 3); threading
  (`new Thread().Start()` is unsupported on the browser — Stage 4); then shaders/audio/saves.
- **Game loop is JS-driven:** `wwwroot/index.html` (`initRenderJS`/`tickJS`) →
  `Pages/Index.razor.cs` `TickDotNet()`. It currently runs the Stage-1 placeholder `SpikeGame`;
  switch to `new EvilAliens.Game1()` in Stage 4.

## Don'ts
- Don't commit `bin/`/`obj/` or the raw 52 MB Xbox package (all `.gitignore`d).
- Don't re-run `tools/*.py` against `Game/` (regenerates it from scratch).
- Don't trust a screenshot for colours/blending while shaders are stubbed.
